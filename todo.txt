################## GOALS #######################
plan to finish by: end of MAY (8 weeks) and then move on to unity because this is taking too much time.

week 1:
- make a better terrain in blender
- make function to create reusable tree assets, add position as argument,
- make a good enough house model

week 2:
- make an afternoon and nighttime LUT
- make a heatmap LUT
- make 3 random cool colour LUT's (cyan and orange?, pink and dark green?, black and white?)

week 3:
- make the loading screen like with the NMH shader

week 4:
- make the move to react fiber and try to make sure everything works, maybe do some refactoring.

week 5:
- convert all of the gltf/glb files into jsx with the gltftojsx library, and figure out how to do collisions.
    - maybe even just say fk it and use a navmesh

week 6:
- flesh out the first area, and find a way to unload the current area, and load another area (white space for now i guess)
    - give it the NMH shader

week 7-8: just make more areas and call it a project and go to unity cuz collisions are so fkd.

################## TODO ########################

todo:
- LUT
    - afternoon
    - nighttime
    - heatmap
- add mosaic tiling and lines
- build actual scene
    - buildings?
- build actual gameplay
    - go around collecting accessories to wear (like the particle effects)
    - appearence manager
- shaders/post processing filters
    - no more heroes loading screen
    - dithering

(for WAYYYYYY later)
- display all the images onto plane geometries
- raycast the camera so it has collision and doesn't phase through the wall
- mosaic rotation and tiling

steps to do:
- create terrain and trees and a house, can add more after
- mess around with LUT's
- no more heroes loading screen shader
- move to react fiber and own workflow because this prebuilt one has too much bloat

######################################################

completed:
- particle system
- add a skysphere (cloudy day, galaxy, stars)
- add cannon bodies for the threejs model
- playerhitboxbody can still jump even in locked screen
- raycaster
- add post processing to make it more psx style
- add a moving player and have the camera move with the player
- create an actual gallery scene
- add a crosshair, or at least have a point ahead of the player to point the camera to. the camera should be looking over the shoulder of the player. the camera is controlled by the mouse.
