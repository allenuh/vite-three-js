changelog (4-03):
features:
    - created terrain, but adding collisions to every face of the model is too difficult, instead will probably use

bugs:
    - async, await, promises to make sure model is loaded before initializing pointerlock https://discourse.threejs.org/t/ghaaaa-why-does-this-produce-an-error/53586/8

    - particle system ripped from Robot Bobby taken inspiration from SimonDev.
    - archimedian spiral with static boxes.
    - repeating texture tiling onto floor, which has turned into a circle geometry instead of a plane, might change it back.

    - increasing pixel post processing will also increase the particles, i think that the particles are the same type as pixels?
        - error was fixed by changing the frustumCulled attribute of the object (_points) to _points.frustumCulled = false;
    - fix movement while looking down
        - error was caused by taking the x and z rotation from pitchObject and yawObject respectively, the solution was to use yawObject for both x and z rotations
